Recording, Next Step:
	DOIT:	Select system configuration (camera) in the beginning

Recording, Long Term:
	Pre-randomized session option
	Load & display a reference frame for adjusting the FOV
	TDT PA5 confirmation
	Matlab hard restart with too high PT camera max shutter value
	Occational file system window freezing during sound loading
	Online display of trial analysis results
	Cancel the session with patial session data save
	panalette momentary's lower button's tip does not display

Analysis:
	Release file handles after finish
	Cancel the video palyback
	FFT base line model and correction
	

New Variables, GUI Elements, & Procedural Steps
	(1) System configuration selection
	(2) Sys: Light source color selection together with wavelength defination
	(3) Sys: Light Configuration = light port + imaging head cube
	(4) Sys: Light Monitor Power Meter Configurations
	(5) Sys: Light Diffuser Options: [0 5 10 15 20]º
	(6) Sys: Camera Lens Aperture Options: f/[1.9 2.8 4 5.6 8 11 16]
	(7) Mky: prep options: (intact skull / window)
	(8) Mky: side & prep are combined into a single 'Toggle' panellete
	(9) Exp: Depth into a slider: [-1 0 1 2 3 4 5] turns on LT1
	(10) Exp: Ref_Image Saving recheck for parameter savings
	(11) Ses: Load with an auto-switch on TrlOrder
		Xin.D.Trl.Load.SoundNumTotal == 1 ,	'Sequential'
		Xin.D.Trl.Load.SoundNumTotal >1		'Randomized');
	(12) Ses: Recording Saving recheck for parameter savings
	(12) Ses: Frame Available and Frame Acquired are combined into a single 'Edit'
	(13) Mon: Preview switch and ROI are combined into a single 'Toggle' panellete
	(14) Mon: Syncrhonized Monitoring Cam Recording:
		No: 		main camera only
		Pupil ONLY: 	main camera together with pupillometry
		Pupil & Body: 	main camera together with pupillometry and body monitoring
	(15) EnableGUI('inactive') updated
Recording Controls
	(1) Cancel session recording in the middle
	(2) Syncrhonized Monitoring Cam Recording with pupilometry & animal monitoring
Hardware Controls:
	(1) Pupillometery is changed from PointGreyCam(3) to PointGreyCam(1) to
		get together with animal monitor on PointGreyCam([1 2]) for recoridng and
		leave flexibility for later sCMOS system configurations without initializing PointGreyCam(3)
	(2) Power Meter @ different modes
		No Monitor:	No PM signal recorded
		Slow Updates: 	10Hz updates from USB reading with 15Hz cutoff filter on PM100A
		Fast Updates: 	100kHz updates from NIDAQ AI recording as before
	(3) NIDAQ backbone
		Monitoring Cameras Trigger Tasks added
		100kHzTimebase output on	RTSI7
		Start trigger on		RTSI6
